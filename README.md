#problems i am still figuring out
- the search filter:i got the filter to identify items with the same string as the input.value but i dont know how to display the search result
- the items in the cart : i think this is because the items in the cart are virtual dom elements, i am having issues selecting the particular item...any selection i make selects all the elements above the present selection.... still figuring it out
- the cart total
